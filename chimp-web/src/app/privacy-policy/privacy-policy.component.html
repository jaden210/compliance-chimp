      <h2>Applicability Of This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to Chimp's online tools (the "Services"), Compliancechimp.com (our Website) and other 
        interactions (e.g., customer service interactions) you may have with Chimp. If you do not agree with the terms, 
        do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other aspect of Chimp's business.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="information-collect" class="legal-section">
      <h2>Information We Collect And Receive</h2>
      <p>Chimp may collect and receive Customer Data and other information in a variety of ways:</p>

      <h3>Customer Data</h3>
      <p>
        Account owners and admins, along with individuals granted access to a team by an account owner or an admin, 
        are considered Authorized Users. Authorized users routinely submit Customer Data to Chimp when using the Services.
      </p>

      <h3>Other Information</h3>
      <p>
        Chimp also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information including business and account Information. 
        To create or update an account, you or your employer supply Chimp with an email address, phone number, password, 
        and/or similar account details. In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Chimp 
        (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address.
      </p>

      <h3>Services Metadata</h3>
      <p>
        When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that gives additional context about 
        the way Authorized Users use the Services. For example, Chimp logs the account, people, pages, content and training 
        you interact with, etc.
      </p>

      <h3>Log Data</h3>
      <p>
        As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information 
        when you access or use our Website or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) 
        address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time 
        the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.
      </p>

      <h3>Device Information</h3>
      <p>
        Chimp collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, 
        device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other 
        Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.
      </p>

      <h3>Location Information</h3>
      <p>
        We may receive information from you that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address 
        submitted by your employer, or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location. 
        Chimp may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device.
      </p>

      <h3>Cookie Information</h3>
      <p>
        Chimp uses cookies and similar technologies in our Website and Services that help us collect Other Information. 
        The Websites and Services may also include cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may 
        collect Other Information about you via the Websites and Services and across other websites and online services.
      </p>

      <h3>Third Party Data</h3>
      <p>
        Chimp may receive data about organizations, industries, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters 
        related to our business from our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. 
        This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate level data, such as which 
        IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online 
        marketing or email campaign performed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="how-we-use" class="legal-section">
      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>
        Customer Data will be used by Chimp in accordance with our Customer Agreement, use of Services functionality, 
        and as required by applicable law. Chimp is a processor of Customer Data and Customer is the controller. Customer may, 
        for example, use the Services to grant and remove access to an account, assign roles and configure settings, access, 
        modify, export, share and remove Customer Data and otherwise apply its policies to the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chimp uses Other Information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our Services, Websites and business. 
        More specifically, Chimp uses Other Information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>To provide, update, maintain and protect our Services, Website and business.</strong> 
          This includes use of Other Information to support delivery of the Services under a Customer Agreement, 
          prevent or address service errors, security or technical issues, analyze and monitor usage, trends and 
          other activities or at an Authorized User's request.
        </li>
        <li><strong>As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation.</strong></li>
        <li>
          <strong>To communicate with you</strong> by responding to your requests, comments and questions. 
          If you contact us, we may use your Other Information to respond.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To develop and provide search or productivity tools and additional features.</strong> 
          Chimp tries to make the Services as useful as possible for Authorized Users. For example, we may 
          improve search functionality by using Other Information to help determine and rank the relevance of content, 
          make Services suggestions based on historical use and predictive models, identify organizational trends 
          and insights, to customize a Services experience or create new productivity features and products.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To send emails and other communications.</strong> We may send you service, technical and other 
          administrative emails, messages and other types of communications. We may also contact you to inform you 
          about changes in our Services, our Services offerings, and important Services-related notices, such as 
          security and fraud notices. These communications are considered part of the Services and you may not opt out 
          of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications or 
          other news about Chimp. These are marketing messages and you may opt out of them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>For billing, account management and other administrative matters.</strong> Chimp may need to contact 
          you for invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts 
          and keep track of billing and payments.
        </li>
        <li><strong>To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If Information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified 
        or identifiable natural person, Chimp may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is 
        associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable 
        data protection law, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Personal Data."

    <section id="security" class="legal-section">
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        Chimp takes security of data very seriously. Chimp works hard to protect Other Information you provide from loss, 
        misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the Other Information 
        we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the nature of communications and information processing technology, Chimp cannot guarantee that Information, 
        during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely 
        safe from intrusion by others.
