    <p class="intro">
      Betterspace, LLC ("Betterspace", "us", "we", "our", or "Compliancechimp") operates Compliancechimp, 
      a web application (referred to as the App from here on out) which enables teams and organizations 
      to achieve OSHA compliance standards. This page sets forth our User Terms of Service 
      and Acceptable Use Policy. By using the App, you agree to these policies.
    </p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>User Terms of Service</h2>
      <p>
        These User Terms of Service (the "User Terms") govern your access and use of the App. 
        These terms are legally binding. Please read them carefully.
      </p>
      <p>You agree to our Acceptable Use Policy, which is laid out in a separate section below.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>You Must be Over the Age of Thirteen</strong> — You represent that you are over the age of thirteen. 
        The App should not be used by anyone under the age of thirteen.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        If we believe that there is a violation of the User Terms or the Acceptable Use Policy that can simply 
        be remedied by you taking action, we will, in most cases, ask you to take action rather than intervene. 
        We may directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action (including disabling your account) 
        if you do not take appropriate action or we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, other users, or the App.
      </p>
      <p class="legal-caps">
        IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR WE HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR FOR ANY 
        INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, 
        TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
        OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND DO NOT 
        LIMIT EITHER PARTY'S RIGHT TO SEEK AND OBTAIN EQUITABLE RELIEF.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Survival</h2>
      <p>
        The sections titled "The Relationship Between You, and Us," "Limitation of Liability," and "Survival," 
        and all of the provisions under the general heading "General Provisions" will survive any termination 
        or expiration of the User Terms.

      <h2>General Provisions</h2>

      <h3>Email Notification</h3>
      <p>
        All notices under the User Terms will be by email. Notices to Compliancechimp should be sent to 
        <a href="mailto:support@compliancechimp.com">support&#64;compliancechimp.com</a>. 
        A notice will be deemed to have been duly given the day after it is sent.
      </p>

      <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Please review our Privacy Policy for more information on how we collect and use data relating 
        to the use and performance of our products.
      </p>

      <h3>Modifications</h3>
      <p>
        As our business evolves, we may change these User Terms or the Acceptable Use Policy. If we make a material 
        change to the User Terms or the Acceptable Use Policy, we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to 
        the change taking effect by emailing the email address associated with your account. You can review the most 
        current version of the User Terms at any time by visiting this page. Any material revisions to these User Terms 
        will become effective on the date set forth in our notice, and all other changes will become effective on the 
        date we publish the change. If you use the App after the effective date of any changes, that use will constitute 
        your acceptance of the revised terms and conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>Pricing</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify our pricing model over time, and to accommodate different pricing tiers 
        based on team size, usage, or other factors.
      </p>

      <h3>Training and Safety</h3>
      <p>
        We provide training content for your benefit. We may modify original training content provided by Government 
        institutions or other sources, in an attempt to increase efficacy, but in no way are we liable for the success 
        or failure of applied training in your specific work environment. It is up to you and your judgment to properly 
        supplement and apply training and training materials to ensure the safety of your workers.
      </p>

      <h3>Waiver</h3>
      <p>
        No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under the User Terms, including the Acceptable Use Policy, 
        will constitute a waiver of that right. No waiver under the User Terms will be effective unless made in writing and 
        signed by an authorized representative of the party being deemed to have granted the waiver.
      </p>

      <h3>Severability</h3>
      <p>
        The User Terms, including the Acceptable Use Policy, will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. 
        If any provision of the User Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will 
        be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest 
        extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of the User Terms will remain in effect.
      </p>

      <h3>Assignment</h3>
      <p>
        You may not assign any of your rights or delegate your obligations under these User Terms, including the Acceptable Use Policy, 
        whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of us (not to be unreasonably withheld). 
        We may assign these User Terms in their entirety (including all terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference), 
        without your consent, to a corporate affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, 
        or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
      </p>

      <h3>Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Fees</h3>
      <p>
        The User Terms, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and any disputes arising out of or related hereto, will be governed 
        by the state of Utah. Each party hereby consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. Each party also 
        hereby waives any right to jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to 
        these User Terms, including the Acceptable Use Policy. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the User Terms, 
        the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney's fees.
      </p>

      <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
      <p>
        The User Terms, including any terms incorporated by reference into the User Terms, constitute the entire agreement between 
        you and us and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning 
        its subject matter. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in these User Terms and any pages 
        referenced in these User Terms, the terms of these User Terms will first prevail.
