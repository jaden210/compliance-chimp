  <div class="pt">How it works.</div>
  <div class="info" style="max-width: none;">Compliancechimp is a Safety Compliance Management System that helps organizations achieve and maintain OSHA compliance. 
    This includes safety training, near miss and injury reporting, self-inspection, and safety record-keeping. We put all safety compliance activities in one place to be consistently performed, reliably reported, and safely stored forever. An explanation of the Safety Compliance Model and how our platform works is below.

    <div class="scrollsub">Safety Compliance Model</div>
    <div class="info" style="max-width: none;">Compliancechimp establishes and maintains the safety compliance model. This is 
      a virtuous cycle of continuous safety improvement. Here's what's required of every employer:    </div>

    <div class="scrollsub">Train</div>
    <div class="info">Provide general and specific safety training to every 
      worker to decrease the chance of a work related injury, illness, or death. Training is to be tracked to the individual, and renewed on timely intervals to ensure top of mind safety practices.
    </div>
    <div class="scrollsub">Inspect</div>
    <div class="info">Maintain a workplace that is free from serious hazards. This is achieved through self-inspection. 
      Self-inspection helps you know what hazards exist, and whether they are under control. This must be performed for every worksite or location,
       and at a frequency that is both reasonable and defensible to keep hazards under control.
    </div>
    <div class="scrollsub">Protect</div>
    <div class="info">Provide workers with the personal protective equipment necessary to guard against injury, 
      illness, or death. Equipment should be regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, and workers must be trained in the use of it, 
      to maintain the highest possible level of safety.
    </div>
    <div class="scrollsub">Record</div>
    <div class="info">Injuries, near misses, citations, self-inspections, and safety trainings down to the individual, 
      must be recorded to establish a record of safety and compliance in the event of an incident, audit, or inspection. Some records, such as 
      injury reports, must be maintained for decades. This data becomes crucial to improve the safety of the organization over time or serve as 
      evidence in an investigation.
    </div>
    <div class="scrollsub">Inform</div>
    <div class="info">Employers must inform workers of citations, injuries, and near-misses. This helps workers 
      understand the potential risks of the job, and affords them the opportunity to better train and prepare themselves. These events 
      create learning experiences for the entire organization, and create a clear basis for improvement and further training.

    <div class="info">Create your account in about a minute, and begin adding your team. Add invididuals one at a time or via file upload. You'll need their name and either a phone number or email address. This estabishes their profile and gets them ready to view training content, respond to training surveys, and report near misses or injuries all from their phone (or any device). <strong>There is no sign up process or login hurdles for your workers.</strong> They become part of the team when you add them to the back office. This makes it ultra easy for them to engage with your safety culture.

    <div class="info">Compliance reaches individual workers thanks to surveys. 
      At the top of every training article, you'll see a “Start Training” button. Clicking that button delivers a survey link to every workers phone via text message. When the training is over, they simlpy click the link to answer whether or not they received the training and if anything is unclear to them. Surveys can also be delivered via email if preferred. Each worker's response is recorded and tracked. No more paper tracking, and no more sporadic tracking efforts. Surveys save time, increase clarity, create evidence of compliance, and help you spot the gaps in training early so you can head problems off. Bonus: custom surveys can be sent to anyone, any time (i.e. "Is any of your PPE outdated or in need of repair?")
